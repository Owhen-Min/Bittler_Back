The film opens with 101-year-old Rose DeWitt Bukater recounting her memories of the Titanic's maiden voyage in April 1912.\r\n\r\nYoung Rose, played by Kate Winslet, is traveling with her wealthy fiancé, Cal Hockley, and her controlling mother. Feeling trapped in her privileged but suffocating life, Rose contemplates suicide by jumping off the ship's stern. She is saved by Jack Dawson, a free-spirited artist played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who won a third-class ticket to the Titanic in a poker game.\r\n\r\nAs Rose and Jack develop a deep connection, they meet secretively, sharing their dreams and desires. Their romance blossoms, defying the constraints of class differences and Rose’s impending marriage to Cal. Jack introduces Rose to the joys of life, painting her in the nude as an expression of freedom. However, Cal becomes suspicious and tries to maintain control over Rose, even going so far as to have Jack arrested.\r\n\r\nOn the night of April 14, 1912, the Titanic strikes an iceberg.

Rose survives, rescued by the lifeboats, and later tells authorities her story. As an elderly woman, she reflects on her memories of Jack, keeping his spirit alive in her heart.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Rose, having lived a long and full life, drops a necklace called the Heart of the Ocean into the sea, symbolically returning to the place where her love story with Jack began. The film concludes with her reuniting with Jack in her dreams, as she finds peace knowing their love transcended the tragedy of the Titanic.",

He seeks to call in a blood oath, a favor that John had once promised to fulfill. Santino wants John to assassinate his sister, Gianna, so that he can take her seat at the high table of the world’s most powerful assassins.\r\n\r\nReluctantly bound by this obligation, John travels to Rome to confront Gianna. Upon finding her, he hesitates, reflecting on his own desire for peace and the life he's lost. Despite this internal conflict, he ultimately carries out the assassination. This act, however, sets off a chain reaction of events, marking John as a target himself.\r\n\r\nAfter completing the mission, Santino double-crosses John, placing a bounty on his head to eliminate any loose ends.

        "plot": "The movie \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\" opens with a recall of the catastrophic events from \"Man of Steel,\" where Superman's battle with General Zod destroyed much of Metropolis. Bruce Wayne, witnessing the destruction firsthand, becomes increasingly concerned about Superman's unchecked power and the potential threat he poses to humanity. As Batman, he begins a crusade against Kryptonians, believing that a god-like being should not be allowed to operate without oversight.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Clark Kent struggles with public perception as Superman, trying to justify his existence and actions in a world that is divided on him. Lex Luthor, a wealthy and influential figure, sees the conflict as an opportunity to manipulate both heroes for his own dark agenda. He orchestrates a series of events designed to pit Batman against Superman, including framing Superman for multiple crimes and using Batman’s paranoia against him.\r\n\r\nAs tensions rise, Luthor manages to gather evidence against Superman, portraying him as a threat to humanity. Bruce, convinced that Superman must be defeated, seeks a way to do so, devising a plan that includes acquiring Kryptonite, the only substance that can weaken Superman. \r\n\r\nThe climax comes when Batman and Superman finally face off.

Batman realizes they are not enemies; they both want to save Martha. They form an uneasy alliance to confront Lex Luthor.\r\n\r\nLuthor's ultimate plan is revealed when he introduces a monstrous creature, Doomsday, created using Zod’s body and Kryptonian technology. Doomsday is a formidable threat, forcing Batman and Superman, alongside Wonder Woman, to unite against this common enemy. The ensuing battle is immense, culminating in the destruction of part of the city as they fight to stop Doomsday from causing mass devastation.\r\n\r\nIn a tragic turn, during the battle, Superman sacrifices himself using a spear laced with Kryptonite to kill Doomsday. This act saves humanity but costs him his life. He dies in the arms of Lois Lane, leaving a profound impact on both Batman and the world at large.\r\n\r\nIn the aftermath of Superman’s death, Bruce Wayne reflects on his actions and the nature of heroism. He resolves to honor Superman’s legacy by seeking to unite a team of heroes, leading to the eventual formation of the Justice League. The film ends with Bruce witnessing the wider implications of his and Superman’s actions, hinting at new challenges ahead while also emphasizing the need for hope and unity in a world without Superman.",

Pyo Hyun-chul, gets separated from his unit and stumbles upon this peaceful village. He soon meets Chief Comrade Lee Su-hwa, a South Korean soldier who accidentally arrives in Dongmakgol after being ambushed by enemy forces.

The film concludes on a tragic note as the soldiers ultimately have to leave the village to confront their obligations in the war, accepting that their time in Dongmakgol was a brief but transformative escape from the chaos. The final scenes reflect on the high cost of war, suggesting that, despite their camaraderie, the division among the soldiers and their loyalty to their respective nations ultimately prevails.",

        "plot": "After the devastating events of \"Avengers: Infinity War,\" the film \"Avengers: Endgame\" picks up with the surviving Avengers grappling with their defeat. The universe remains in ruins following Thanos's snap, which eliminated half of all life. The remaining heroes—Tony Stark (Iron Man), Steve Rogers (Captain America), Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), Bruce Banner (Hulk), and Thor—are devastated and lost without their fallen comrades.\r\n\r\nFive years after the snap, Scott Lang (Ant-Man) escapes from the quantum realm and proposes a plan to the remaining Avengers. He believes they could use time travel to revisit key moments in their past and retrieve the Infinity Stones before Thanos can gather them. The Avengers devise a risky plan called the \"Time Heist,\" enlisting the help of Rocket Raccoon and later, the newly resurrected Hawkeye, and also bringing in Captain Marvel to assist.\r\n\r\nThe Avengers split into teams to go back to various points in time across the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

        "plot": "In \"The Dark Knight,\" the story begins with the chaotic aftermath of Gotham City's battle against organized crime. Batman, portrayed by Christian Bale, is determined to dismantle the criminal organizations plaguing the city. With the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), Batman works to clean up Gotham, and for a while, it seems like real progress is being made.\r\n\r\nHowever, their efforts attract the attention of a new villain, the Joker, played by Heath Ledger. The Joker is a chaotic force of nature who thrives on creating fear and disorder. He quickly begins to unravel the fragile peace the city has achieved. He challenges Batman's moral code, targeting those close to him, including Dent and Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), Bruce Wayne's love interest.\r\n\r\nAs the Joker executes a series of audacious crimes, he captures the public's imagination and strikes terror into the hearts of Gotham's citizens. He orchestrates a bank heist that results in a huge sum of money being stolen, and he uses this fortune to fund his reign of terror. The Joker forces Batman to confront the ethical dilemmas of his vigilante justice, pushing him to the limits of his morality.\r\n\r\nHarvey Dent, initially seen as a beacon of hope for Gotham, falls victim to the Joker's manipulations. After a horrific encounter following a failed attempt to rescue Rachel, Dent’s face is scarred, leading to his transformation into the vengeful anti-hero Two-Face. Consumed by anger and seeking revenge, he begins to enact his own brand of justice, targeting those he sees as responsible for his and Rachel’s anguish.\r\n\r\nAs the tension escalates, the Joker captures both Dent and Rachel, entombing them in separate locations rigged with explosives. Batman, aware of the Joker's sadistic game, races against time to save them. Tragically, he is too late to prevent a horrifying turn of events: Rachel dies in the explosion, and Dent is left severely disfigured, spiraling into vengeance as Two-Face.\r\n\r\nThe climax of the film unfolds in a series of dramatic confrontations as Batman grapples with the implications of his actions and the Joker's chaotic philosophy. The Joker takes hostages on two ferries, each loaded with explosives, forcing the passengers to choose between their own lives and the lives of others. In a tense twist, neither ferry explodes, revealing the inherent goodness in humanity, much to the Joker's frustration.\r\n\r\nThe final confrontation sees Batman tracking down the Joker, who has taken Dent hostage. A chaotic battle ensues, and Batman ultimately chooses to bear the blame for Dent's crimes to maintain Dent's legacy as Gotham's white knight. He believes preserving Dent’s reputation is vital for the city’s hope.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Batman, now branded a fugitive, disappears into the night, becoming the symbol of the vigilante Gotham needs but does not understand. The film closes with Gotham on the brink of despair and uncertainty, showcasing the heavy cost of heroism and the complex interplay between good and evil. The Joker's reign may be over, but his chaotic influence has left an indelible mark on Gotham and its protectors.",

        "plot": "In \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\" we meet Charlie Bucket, a kind-hearted boy living in a small, run-down house in London with his impoverished family. His parents and four grandparents all struggle to make ends meet, while Charlie dreams of a better life and, most importantly, of chocolate. \r\n\r\nOne day, Willy Wonka, the eccentric and reclusive owner of the world's most magnificent chocolate factory, announces a contest: five golden tickets hidden in his chocolate bars. The lucky finders will win an exclusive tour of the factory and a lifetime supply of chocolate. Charlie's luck seems bleak until he miraculously finds a golden ticket in a chocolate bar he discovers while rummaging through a waste bin. \r\n\r\nThe other ticket winners are a group of exceptionally flawed children: Augustus Gloop, an overweight boy who can't control his appetite; Veruca Salt, a spoiled girl who gets everything she wants; Violet Beauregarde, an ambitious girl obsessed with gum; and Mike Teavee, a television-obsessed boy. Accompanied by his Grandpa Joe, who encourages him, Charlie enters the whimsical world of Willy Wonka's factory.\r\n\r\nInside the factory, which is filled with fantastical rooms and extraordinary inventions, the children encounter various magical wonders like the Chocolate River, edible plants, and the Oompa Loompas, Wonka's small, singing workers. However, as the tour progresses, the other children's greed and shortcomings lead to their downfalls: Augustus falls into the chocolate river, Veruca is deemed a \"bad nut\" and thrown down a garbage chute, Violet turns into a giant blueberry after chewing an experimental gum, and Mike is shrunk down after getting stuck in a television set. \r\n\r\nThroughout the tour, Charlie demonstrates humility, kindness, and integrity, much to Willy Wonka's initial surprise. The factory's owner, who has a complex history with his strict father, learns from Charlie about the importance of love and family. \r\n\r\nBy the end of the tour, only Charlie remains, and Wonka surprises him by revealing that the true prize for finding the golden ticket is not just the chocolate but the factory itself. Wonka invites Charlie and his family to live in the factory, finally escaping their poverty. The story ends on a note of hope and renewal, as Charlie learns that true happiness comes from family and love, and Willy Wonka begins to heal from his troubled past through the boy's innocence and goodness.",
